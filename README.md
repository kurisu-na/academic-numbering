# Academic Numbering - A Google Docs Add-On

# Version
1.0.0

# Installation
You can find this add-on at Google Workspace Marketplace under the name "Academic Numbering." The URL will be added later.

# Description
Frustrated because Google Docs doesn't have figure and table numbering feature yet? Yeah, me too. Thankfully, I was introduced to [Markdown Tools](https://github.com/jordan2175/markdown-tools), made by Bret Jordan.
The add-on doesn't have figure and table numbering feature, but can auto-number your headings. I modified the add-on's code by:
- Removing the Markdown features (because I don't really use it at work)
- Modifying the Heading Numbering code to only Heading 4
- Adding the code, based on his code, to auto-number Heading 5 into Figure numbering
- Adding the code, based on his code, to auto-number Heading 6 into Table numbering

Apart from my modifications, the software still functions pretty much the same way.
To add a Table of Contents, you can use Google Docs' native TOC function. You can select which heading level to display at each TOC. For example, the TOC will have Headings 1 to 4, while the List of Figures will have Heading 5 only, and the List of Tables will have Heading 6 only.
