  <h1>Academic Numbering - A Google Docs Add-On</h1>
  
  <h2>Version</h2>
  <p>1.0.0</p>
  
  <h2>Installation</h2>
  <p>You can find this add-on at Google Workspace Marketplace under the name "Academic Numbering." The URL will be added later.</p>
  
  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Frustrated because Google Docs doesn't have figure and table numbering feature yet? Yeah, me too. Thankfully, I was introduced to <a href="https://github.com/jordan2175/markdown-tools">Markdown Tools</a>, made by Bret Jordan.</p>
  <p>The add-on doesn't have figure and table numbering feature, but can auto-number your headings. I modified the add-on's code by:</p>
    <li>Removing the Markdown features (because I don't really use it at work)</li>
    <li>Modifying the Heading Numbering code to only Heading 4</li>
    <li>Adding the code, based on his code, to auto-number Heading 5 into Figure numbering</li>
    <li>Adding the code, based on his code, to auto-number Heading 6 into Table numbering</li>
  <p>Apart from my modifications, the software still functions pretty much the same way.</p>
  <p>To add a Table of Contents, you can use Google Docs' native TOC function. You can select which heading level to display at each TOC. For example, the TOC will have Headings 1 to 4, while the List of Figures will have Heading 5 only, and the List of Tables will have Heading 6 only.</p>
